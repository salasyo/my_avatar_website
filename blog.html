      <h2>Stevie Wonder
        American singer, composer, and musician by Richard Williams</h2>
      <p>Stevie Wonder, original name Stevland Hardaway Judkins, also called Stevland Hardaway Morris, (born May 13, 1950, Saginaw, Michigan, U.S.), American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, a child prodigy who developed into one of the most creative musical figures of the late 20th century. 
        Blind from birth and raised in inner-city Detroit, he was a skilled musician by age eight. Renamed Little Stevie Wonder by Berry Gordy, Jr., the president of Motown Records—to whom he was introduced by Ronnie White, a member of the Miracles—Wonder made his recording debut at age 12. The soulful quality of his high-pitched singing and the frantic harmonica playing that characterized his early recordings were evident in his first hit single, “Fingertips (Part 2),” recorded during a show at Chicago’s Regal Theatre in 1963. But Wonder was much more than a freakish prepubescent imitation of Ray Charles, as audiences discovered when he demonstrated his prowess with piano, organ, harmonica, and drums. By 1964 he was no longer described as “Little,” and two years later his fervent delivery of the pounding soul of “Uptight (Everything’s Alright),” which he also had written, suggested the emergence of both an unusually compelling performer and a composer to rival Motown’s stable of skilled songwriters. (He had already cowritten, with Smokey Robinson, “The Tears of a Clown.”) </p>
      <p>Over the next five years Wonder had hits with “I Was Made to Love Her,” “My Cherie Amour” (both cowritten with producer Henry Cosby), and “For Once in My Life,” songs that suited dancers as well as lovers. Where I’m Coming From, an album released in 1971, hinted not merely at an expanded musical range but, in its lyrics and its mood, at a new introspection. Music of My Mind (1972) made his concerns even more plain. In the interim he had been strongly influenced by Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On, the album in which his Motown stablemate moved away from the label’s “hit factory” approach to confront the divisive social issues of the day. Any anxieties Gordy may have felt about his protégé’s declaration of independence were amply calmed by the run of recordings with which Wonder obliterated the competition in the mid-1970s. Talking Book (1972), Innervisions (1973), Fulfillingness’ First Finale (1974), and Songs in the Key of Life (1976) were all regarded as masterpieces, and the last three of them won a slew of Grammy Awards, each of them being named album of the year. Those albums produced a steady stream of classic hit songs, among them “Superstition,” “You Are the Sunshine of My Life,” “Higher Ground,” “Living for the City,” “Don’t You Worry ’Bout a Thing,” “Boogie On Reggae Woman,” “I Wish,” and “Sir Duke.” </p>
      <p>Although still only in his mid-20s, Wonder appeared to have mastered virtually every idiom of African-American popular music and to have synthesized them all into a language of his own. His command of the new generation of electronic keyboard instruments made him a pioneer and an inspiration to rock musicians, the inventiveness of his vocal phrasing was reminiscent of the greatest jazz singers, and the depth and honesty of his emotional projection came straight from the Black church music of his childhood. Such a fertile period was unlikely to last forever, and it came to an end in 1979 with a fey and overambitious extended work called Stevie Wonder’s Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants. Thereafter his recordings became sporadic and often lacked focus, although his concerts were never less than rousing. The best of his work formed a vital link between the classic rhythm-and-blues and soul performers of the 1950s and ’60s and their less commercially constrained successors. Yet, however sophisticated his music became, he was never too proud to write something as apparently slight as the romantic gem “I Just Called to Say I Love You” (1984). 
        Wonder was the recipient of numerous honours. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and in 1999 he was awarded the Polar Music Prize for lifetime achievement by the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. That year he also became a Kennedy Center honoree. In 2005 Wonder received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement. Four years later he was awarded the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song from the Library of Congress, and he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014. </p>

      <h2>Stevie Wonder: 'I never thought of being blind and black as a disadvantage' by Paul Lester</h2>
      <p>All right, mate?" chirrups Stevie Wonder in a mockney accent last tried by Dick Van Dyke. He is tired, hardly surprising given it is 2.30am where he lives in California, but that doesn't stop him from acting his usual playful self. Nor does it prevent him from talking at length about his 50-year career, and the events that shaped it. 
        He's not one to hold back. Before long, he is vividly remembering the car crash in which he nearly lost his life. It was 1973, and the sedan in which he was travelling careened into a truck. His wounds were severe. 
        "It was on 6 August that I almost died in that car accident," he recalls. It was a key date for another reason. "It was also on 6 August – 1988 – that my son Kwame was born. Life is funny." 
        Does the crash remain the signal event of his life? 
        "It is significant," he replies, and it's a typical Wonder response, "but I was blessed to come out of it. God gave me life to continue to do things that I would never have done." </p>
      <p>Principal among these was the electrification of modern soul that he effected on his extraordinary series of 70s albums. They have exerted a tremendous influence on musicians, from Michael Jackson and Prince in the 80s to rapper Drake and this year's most lauded new R&B star, Frank Ocean. 
        "Yeah, I like Frank," says Wonder, who sang the hook from Ocean's No Church In The Wild to the Odd Future sensation when he met him at a party recently. The feeling is mutual: reviews of Ocean's 2012 album, Channel Orange, drew comparisons with Wonder's music at its most expansive.    
        After being consigned to MOR-soul hell following the likes of I Just Called To Say I Loved You, Wonder – who next week headlines Bestival – is hip again. Is there anybody who doesn't like him? 
        "Heh," he chuckles, then pauses. "Well, there are those. But we don't like to think about that."  
        No, Wonder-haters are few. Maybe he's thinking of his early days. In Where Did Our Love Go?, a history of Motown, Nelson George noted the jealousy among staffers towards the 12-year-old-genius, even if detractors were soon silenced by his fabulous run of mainly self-penned hits: Uptight (Everything's Alright), For Once In My Life, My Cherie Amour and Signed, Sealed, Delivered. </p>
      <p>In 1971, he released the transitional Where I'm Coming From, which along with Marvin Gaye's What's Going On was the first serious album from a label accustomed to singles. It was a brave departure from the Motown sound, with forays into psychedelia, baroque pop and folk-inflected soul.  
        "I had fun doing that album with [ex-wife] Syreeta," he says. "Berry [Gordy, Motown boss] said: 'Do your thing.'"
        He recalls writing the song If You Really Love Me at the apartment of Laura Nyro, no stranger herself to the startling chord sequence. Fellow Motown songwriter Smokey Robinson, however, was unimpressed with his new direction after he saw Wonder on comedian Flip Wilson's TV show. 
        "I got a call from Smokey and he says: 'I didn't like your choice of material. I think it's really ridiculous.' I said: 'I don't give a "uh" what you think, or what anyone thinks!' That was my growing-up moment at Motown."  </p>

      <h2>Music Legend Stevie Wonder: From Child Prodigy To Superhero by SPYSCAPE</h2>
      <p>Born Stevland Hardaway Judkins in 1950, he grew up in Saginaw, Michigan, about 100 miles from Detroit. It was a difficult birth. Wonder was six weeks premature and placed in an oxygen-heavy incubator, which is believed to have contributed to his eye disorder - retinopathy of prematurity - causing his blindness. He’s always taken it in stride, however. 
        "Do you know, it's funny," Wonder told The Guardian, "but I never thought of being blind as a disadvantage, and I never thought of being black as a disadvantage. I am what I am. I love me! And I don't mean that egotistically - I love that God has allowed me to take whatever it was that I had and to make something out of it."  
        Wonder showed an early gift for music, singing in the Whitestone Baptist Church choir and learning to play the piano, harmonica, and drums. He partnered with a friend and performed on street corners and at parties and dances.</p>
      <p>As a young teenager, Wonder performed with the Motown Revue in Alabama. It was the first time he’d experienced segregation. He later recalled someone shooting at the musicians’ tour bus, just barely missing the gas tank.  
        At 15, Wonder attended a Chicago Freedom Movement rally where he met the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., his hero. King’s speech on the Montgomery Bus Boycott - an African American protest against segregated seating - had stuck with Wonder since the age of five: “I asked, ‘Why don’t they like colored people? What’s the difference? I still can’t see the difference. Want to know why? Because there is no difference.” 
        On the evening of 4 April 1968, Wonder was on his way back to Detroit from the Michigan School for the Blind when the news broke on the radio that King had been assassinated in Memphis. His driver immediately switched off the radio and they traveled the rest of the way home in shock and silence. 
        </p>
      <p>Five days later, Wonder flew to Atlanta to join thousands mourning the loss of the civil rights hero. At the funeral, Wonder was joined by African-American Congressman John Conyers, who had just submitted a bill to make King’s birthday a national holiday but the measure failed to gain popular support. The idea ignited a crusade to commemorate the slain civil rights icon, however, a movement spearheaded by Wonder and some of the biggest names in music including Bob Marley and Michael Jackson. 
        To fight the pushback from conservative politicians, Wonder put his musical career on hold and led rallies from coast to coast, galvanizing millions of Americans with his passion and lobbying Congress to pass the bill. Wonder had a vision for a national day of love, peace and unity.
